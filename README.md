One day my friends told me to play Wordle, a word guessing game. I didn't know anything about it, but once I started playing, I was hooked. I looked up "Wordle" on Google and Youtube, and saw the unbelievable success it had. Later, I read on the news that the New York Times bought the game for 7 figures. I was amazed at this, because it seemed to be a relatively simple concept. In fact, the creator had just made for his wife during quarantine! This inspired me, and so I thought why not make my own version? Using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, I created a Wordle Clone. As of right now, the game isn't finished, as I still have to add some aspects.
